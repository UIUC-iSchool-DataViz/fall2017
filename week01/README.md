# Week 1 - Introduction

This week, we covered a few important topics -- what we'll be discussing in
class, how we can think about visualization, and our first assignment.

## Materials

 * [Original slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uUuYYNLsM9JWtKJ_8CxQ-h1YcUwdT4ugIai7B6WYyGU/edit?usp=sharing)

## Assignment

 * Identify three visualizations in pop culture
   * Movies / TV / Music videos
   * Everyday life
   * Advertisements
 * Describe each one in detail
   * Where did the data come from?
   * Is the data quantitative, qualitative, categorical, etc?
   * How was the data processed before being displayed?
   * What method was used to display that data?
 * Replicate the visualization with different, but similarly “shaped,” data
   * By hand is acceptable
   * Computational methods should include source code

Send a PDF of this, and in addition bring a printed copy to class next week to
turn in.
