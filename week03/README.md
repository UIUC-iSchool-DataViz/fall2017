# Week 3 - Elements of a Visualization

This week we covered some basic quantitative visualization, making good choices
when trying to figure out just how many variables to cram onto a single page,
and looking at some basics of using matplotlib.  Sadly, I had a fever and was
only able to go for 2 of our scheduled 3 hours.
