# Week 6 - Choosing a Visualization Type and Choosing Colors

This week, we discussed how humans perceive color, and how that influences our
choice of colors in our visualizations.

We started out by discussing a visualization of movie posters, and how the
colors in them has changed over time.  We moved on to rediscussing the
mechanisms by which data might be stored on disk, and in particular, why some
formats are easier for different types of data than others.

The bulk of our discussion related to color maps.  We covered different types
(using the colorbrewer nomenclature) and why perceptually uniform colormaps
provide benefits in most circumstances.  We spent some time discussing
accessibility of colormaps as well.

Our demo used a brain imaging scan as a basis for exploring color maps.
