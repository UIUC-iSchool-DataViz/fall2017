# Week 7 - Comparisons, Compositions and Time

This week, we started building out comparisons and compositions of datasets for
visualization purposes.  During the interactive examples we started using
[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) for the first time.

This week's pandas work didn't go that well, so we followed up the following
week.
