# Week 2 - Data Formats, Operational Palette, and Basic Python

This week we covered some basics of data formats (CSV, HDF5, JSON) and how rows
and columns are stored, and we moved on to talk about methods for operating on
datasets from a high level.  We then did a few basic Python operations and made
our first plot.
