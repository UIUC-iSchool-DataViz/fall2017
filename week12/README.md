# Week 12 - Scientific Viz and Infographics

This week we spoke a bit about the needs of scientific viz, and a couple
libraries for doing it in Python.  We also delved much deeper into bqplot, and
how to use it for interactive visualization in Jupyter.

The lecture slides have had all of the infographics removed; see the online
slides for the links and originals.

## Other Information

The bqplot documentation at http://bqplot.readthedocs.org/ has a good amount of
information; the bqplot source code repository has more interactivity examples
in the
[Interactions](https://github.com/bloomberg/bqplot/tree/master/examples/Interactions)
directory.
