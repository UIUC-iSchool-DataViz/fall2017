# Week 4 - Weights, Histograms, and Binning

This week included a presentation from Dr. Jill Naiman about her work on
visualization.  We then discussed different methods of histogramming and
weighting distributions of data, how that can be manipulated to present
different things depending on the type of weighting or averaging, and then we
explored methods for displaying these things.
